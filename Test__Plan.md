# My Approach and General Suggestions

## Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, and approach for testing our project. This also gives you a guideline about how I prepare for a TEST Plan and you can also do these before starting to test a project. 

## Objectives
- Ensure all features work as per the requirements provided by the client
- Identify and fix bugs based on priority and deadline
- Improve code quality and maintainability
- Document everything you've done and what you haven't done (also).

## Scope
- Functional Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Regression Testing
- Load Testing (if your system is expecting a lot of customer at a time, then you must not skip this).

### UAT
- Conduct a UAT session with the clients before your final delivery: this will improve your relationship with the client and subsequently reduce the no of bugs

## Sample Test Case
- For a sample test case report please visit this repository and send a request.

## Test Criteria
### Entry Criteria
- All code has been committed to the repository
- Development has been completed for the current sprint
- QA Documentation has been completed for the current sprint. 

### Exit Criteria
- All critical and high-severity bugs have been fixed
- Test coverage is above 90%
- Get green light from client (if UAT is conducted)

## Test Deliverables to Client and Other Teams
- Test Cases
- Bug Reports
- Test Summary Report.
